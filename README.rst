Usage
=====

 1. (optional) Modify the list if needed.
 
 2. Generate config file:

    .. code:: sh

      # use DNS server 10.10.0.21, make dnsmasq config
      make SERVER=10.10.0.21 dnsmasq
      # or if you use unbound
      make unbound

    Then move the generated files to ``/etc/dnsmasq.d`` or corresponding places,
    and *include* them in main config file.
